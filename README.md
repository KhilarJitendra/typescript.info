# TypeScript Learning Hub 🚀

A comprehensive, hands-on guide to mastering TypeScript from basics to advanced concepts. This repository contains structured exercises and examples designed to build your TypeScript expertise step by step.

## 📚 Repository Structure

This learning hub is organized into two main sections:

### 🌱 **Basics** (`/basics/`)
Foundation concepts every TypeScript developer needs to know:

- **[E01: TypeScript Basics](./basics/E01.md)** - Why TypeScript? Type checking, inference, and strict mode
- **[E02: Everyday Types](./basics/E02.md)** - Primitives, arrays, objects, unions, and type aliases
- **[E03: Narrowing](./basics/E03.md)** - Type guards, truthiness, equality, and discriminated unions
- **[E04: Functions](./basics/E04.md)** - Function types, parameters, overloads, and type safety
- **[E05: Objects](./basics/E05.md)** - Object types, optional properties, readonly, and index signatures

### 🚀 **Advanced** (`/advanced/`)
Deep dive into sophisticated TypeScript features:

- **[E01: Generics](./advanced/E01.md)** - Reusable type-safe components and constraints
- **[E02: Keyof Operator](./advanced/E02.md)** - Type-safe property access and manipulation
- **[E03: Typeof Operator](./advanced/E03.md)** - Extract types from values and runtime checks
- **[E04: Indexed Access Types](./advanced/E04.md)** - Access nested type properties dynamically
- **[E05: Conditional Types](./advanced/E05.md)** - Type-level if statements and logic
- **[E06: Mapped Types](./advanced/E06.md)** - Transform existing types systematically
- **[E07: Template Literal Types](./advanced/E07.md)** - String manipulation at the type level
- **[E08: Classes](./advanced/E08.md)** - Object-oriented programming with TypeScript
- **[E09: Modules](./advanced/E09.md)** - Code organization and module systems
- **[E10: Utility Types](./advanced/E10.md)** - Built-in TypeScript helpers and transformations
- **[E11: Declaration Files](./advanced/E11.md)** - Type definitions and ambient declarations
- **[E12: TypeScript Configuration](./advanced/E12.md)** - tsconfig.json mastery and project setup

## 🎯 Learning Path

### For Beginners
Start with the **Basics** section in order:
1. TypeScript Basics → 2. Everyday Types → 3. Narrowing → 4. Functions → 5. Objects

### For Intermediate Developers
Jump to **Advanced** concepts that interest you, or follow this recommended path:
1. Generics → 2. Keyof/Typeof → 3. Conditional Types → 4. Mapped Types → 5. Utility Types

### For Advanced Users
Focus on specific topics like Template Literal Types, Declaration Files, or TypeScript Configuration.
